# Usage
# $ gh copilot --help
# Your AI command line copilot.
# Usage:
#   copilot [command]
# Examples:
# $ gh copilot suggest "Install git"
# $ gh copilot explain "traceroute github.com"
# Available Commands:
#   alias       Generate shell-specific aliases for convenience
#   config      Configure options
#   explain     Explain a command
#   suggest     Suggest a command
# Flags:
#   -h, --help              help for copilot
#       --hostname string   The GitHub host to use for authentication
#   -v, --version           version for copilot
# Use "copilot [command] --help" for more information about a command.
# Multi-account notes
# Multi-account users can use --hostname flag or GH_HOST environment variable to specify the GitHub hostname for commands that would otherwise assume the github.com host.
# Set up optional helpers
# Is gh copilot suggest ... too many keystrokes? Do you want support for executing suggestions and keeping them in history?
# v1.0.0 introduces gh copilot alias, which generates shell configuration for ghcs and ghce aliases that wrap gh copilot suggest and gh copilot explain. These aliases provide faster invocation and support executing suggested commands if applicable. Executed suggestions are added to your shell history for reuse later.
