# Is gh copilot suggest ... too many keystrokes? Do you want support for executing suggestions and keeping them in history?
# v1.0.0 introduces gh copilot alias, which generates shell configuration for ghcs and ghce aliases that wrap gh copilot suggest and gh copilot explain. These aliases provide faster invocation and support executing suggested commands if applicable. Executed suggestions are added to your shell history for reuse later.

# Install GitHub CLI

# Authenticate with GitHub CLI OAuth app (this will open a browser window for authentication)
# In a Colab environment, this might require additional setup or a different
# authentication method. This command is provided as an example.
print("Please follow the instructions in the browser window to authenticate with GitHub.")
!gh auth login --web

# You can check if authentication was successful by trying a command that requires authentication
# For example:
# !gh repo list your_github_username

# Install the gh-copilot extension (this requires GitHub CLI to be installed and authenticated)
# !gh extension install github/gh-copilot --force

# You can now use gh copilot commands if the extension was installed successfully
# For example:
# !gh copilot suggest "How to clone a GitHub repository"
# !gh copilot explain "git clone <repository_url>"
